# CyberSecProjects
This is a repository for cybersecurity related projects that I am working on in my spare time for study and for fun.

I will maintain a list of the included projects and a summary of what they do as follows:

- rotter.py
	Takes an input of ciphertext and runs it through a number of rotational ciphers, giving output to help indicate if the ciphertext resolves to anything useful in a given rotational cipher. Currently only handles basic Caeser cipher using alphabet characters. Will be updated with further character sets and other rotational cipher permutations.
